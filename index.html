            <h3 class="heading">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul id="info-list">
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br>thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br>Administration"</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the<br> Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how<br>food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br>budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br>study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-<br>resistent plants.</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but<br>is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof<br>glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied<br>science.</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br>program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different<br>strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for<br>each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling<br>wheat yields</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-<br>yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to<br>fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the<br>Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to<br>a rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their<br>maize and sorghum yields</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br> Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can<br>meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops<br>are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically<br> modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called<br>it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li class="info-list"><span id="date">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
            </ul>
